When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The time I want to show my repository publicly or collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe because manual work can be more flexible.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: copy repository from GitHub to GitHub
clones: copy repository from GitHub or local computers to local computer
branches: a bundle of commits that are different from the commits of the master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It will become easy to synchronize the local repository with the remote repository.(need to think deeply)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Manually combine the codes of collaborators. It's easier to combine the codes that have less changes.
And it's harder to combine the codes that have many changes or of many collaborators.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?
The time when I want to do some experimental works or make a pull request on GitHub.
in separate branch: can do more things without breaking the official codes of the master branch, clearly
directly in master: conveniently, more effectively
