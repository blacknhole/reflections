When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The time I want to show my repository publicly or collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe because manual work can be more flexible.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: copy repository from GitHub to GitHub
clones: copy repository from GitHub or local computers to local computer
branches: a bundle of commits that are different from the commits of the master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It will become easy to synchronize the local repository with the remote repository.(need to think deeply)
